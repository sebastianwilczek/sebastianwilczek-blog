      Making time is difficult. Focusing on a single highlight makes creating
      time a lot easier. But what about the tasks you initially do not even want
      to make time for? Can they be transformed into daily highlights?

        We are always supposed to make time. Time for our jobs, our hobbies,
        friends, family, walking the dog, cleaning up. We are supposed to make
        time to relax. How ironic.

        As many of you can probably relate, I have spent a reasonable amount of
        time just managing my time. A meeting here, an appointment there, and
        make sure to cram your relationships in there as well! I often found
        myself in a constant battle for and against time. Given my passion for
        tinkering with all things tech, as well as also trying to lead something
        that resembles a somewhat healthy lifestyle, different priorities often
        competed with each other for my precious time. The aftermath usually
        looked like my calender became a Jackson Pollock painting. I needed to
        optimize.

      <p className="paragraph">
        Of course, the Internet has no shortage of guides and tips to manage
        time. My personal favourite actually comes straight from the hands of
        two people who helped create some of our biggest time drains: Jake Knapp
        and John Zeratsky. Before they wrote the book that made me rethink time
        and the activities I pursue, they worked for Google, and, while doing
        so, created software that you probably use on the regular: YouTube and
        Gmail. If anyone knows anything about time and how you spend it, they
        would surely make the list.

      <p className="paragraph">
        They condensed their thoughts and, more importantly, their actions
        regarding time into one book: <i>"Make time"</i>. If I were to put it
        into one sentence (for the sake of time), I'd describe it as{" "}
        <i>"a collection of actionable advice to get shit done"</i>. However,
        this short condensation is not accurate. If anything, the book tells you
        to not get as much shit done as you may think. One of the main things
        the book refers to is the <i>"busy bandwagon"</i>, the idea that being
        busy all the time at 100% is a really good thing. Spoiler: It is not.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        As mentioned, the book basically has a list of things to do to make room
        in your day/week/life for the things you want to do. It makes you make
        time. One particular advice stood out to me: the idea of a daily
        highlight. As I am writing this, I am also eating a bucket of ice cream.
        While satisfying, it is not my highlight of the day. What the authors
        refer to when mentioning a 'highlight' is, in simple terms, the thing
        you want to do today. This may sound obvious, but do you really focus on
        one thing each day? One thing you really want to do? The answers is
        likely no, unless you followed the authors advice or a similar strategy.
        The main idea is:{" "}
        <i>
          "If you do a daily highlight every day, after a year you will have
          done 365 things that mattered."
        </i>
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        When I started "making time" in form of a daily highlight, I was also
        highly sceptical. Of course I could find a thing to do each day that I
        would really like to do. Hell, I could find 365 things right then and
        there!
