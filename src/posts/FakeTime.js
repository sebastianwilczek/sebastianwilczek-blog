      Making time is difficult. Focusing on a single highlight makes creating
      time a lot easier. But what about the tasks you initially do not even want
      to make time for? Can they be transformed into daily highlights? I tried,
      and in the process I tricked my brain into enjoying the mundane.

        We are always supposed to make time. Time for our jobs, our hobbies,
        friends, family, walking the dog, cleaning up. We are supposed to make
        time to relax. How ironic.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        As many of you can probably relate, I have spent a reasonable amount of
        time just managing my time. A meeting here, an appointment there, and
        make sure to cram your relationships in there as well! I often found
        myself in a constant battle for and against time. Given my passion for
        tinkering with all things tech, as well as also trying to lead something
        that resembles a somewhat healthy lifestyle, different priorities often
        competed with each other for my precious time. The aftermath usually
        looked like my calendar became a Jackson Pollock painting. I needed to
        optimize.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Of course, the Internet has no shortage of guides and tips to manage
        time. My personal favorite comes straight from the hands of two people
        who helped create some of our biggest time drains, Jake Knapp and John
        Zeratsky. Before they wrote the book that made me rethink time and the
        activities I pursue, they worked for Google, and, while doing so,
        created software that you probably use on the regular: YouTube and
        Gmail. If anyone knows anything about time and how you spend it, they
        would surely make the list.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        They condensed their thoughts and, more importantly, their actions
        regarding time into one book: <i>"Make time"</i>. If I were to put it
        into one sentence (for the sake of time), I'd describe it as{" "}
        <i>"a collection of actionable advice to get shit done"</i>. However,
        this short condensation is not accurate. If anything, the book tells you
        to not get as much shit done as you may think. One of the main things
        the book refers to is the <i>"busy bandwagon"</i>, the idea that being
        busy all the time at 100% is a really good thing. Spoiler: It is not.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        As mentioned, the book has a list of things to do to make room in your
        day/week/life for the things you want to do. It makes you make time. One
        particular piece of advice is heavily mentioned by the authors and stood
        out to me: the idea of a daily highlight. As I am writing this, I am
        also eating a bucket of ice cream. While satisfying, it is not my
        highlight of the day. What the authors refer to when mentioning a
        'highlight' is, in simple terms, the thing you want to do today. This
        may sound obvious, but do you focus on one thing each day? One thing you
        want to do? The answer is likely no unless you followed the authors'
        advice or a similar strategy. The main idea is:{" "}
        <i>
          "If you do a daily highlight every day, after a year you will have
          done at least 365 things that mattered."
        </i>
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        When I started "making time" in form of a daily highlight, I was also
        highly skeptical. Of course, I could find a thing to do each day that I
        would like to do. Hell, I could find 365 things right then and there! My
        problem was not that I did not know what I wanted to do, my problem was
        that I had way too many different things to do that were in the way of
        me enjoying my highlight, or the activities I enjoy in general. That
        much was obvious, or at least I thought so.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Nonetheless, I gave it my best shot. For a while, every day, I marked an
        event in my calendar to be the designated highlight of the day. The
        activities themselves were rather varied, encompassing things such as
        trying out a new recipe to cook, implementing a feature in one of my
        projects, or spending time doing some activities with my girlfriend or
        perhaps one or more good friends. And while the activities themselves
        crossed a large range of topics, there were a few common properties all
        highlights shared. Usually, I planned around 1-2 hours for the
        highlight, and I placed it sometime in the afternoon or evening. If
        something else came up, I always attempted to make my highlight the
        priority, rescheduling or canceling whatever else may happen at the
        time. And I always marked the daily highlight in a{" "}
        <span style={{ color: "red" }}>bright red</span> in my schedule.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Looking back at it, this seemed to have worked reasonably well. Every
        day, some time was set aside for an activity that I enjoyed, and I was
        able to focus on that, and only that. Perhaps I even made more progress
        in what I was doing. In all honesty, I did not time-track my activities
        to the millisecond for the sake of science. Gut-feeling: I spent more
        time with things I enjoy. However, there was a lingering thought
        remaining. I am only spending time with things I would have likely done
        similarly, I am just mindful that I am doing them every day. Some tasks
        are still not in my focus, and my attention to them may even suffer due
        to me just focusing on the good stuff.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">And then, something peculiar happened.</p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        One day, I started an experiment without even realizing I did so. I
        would like for you to read the title of the event I put into my calendar
        that day:
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        <span style={{ color: "red" }}>
          <i>Highlight of the Day: Wash the car</i>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        At this point, you may be asking yourself: why does this guy enjoy
        washing his car so much that he dedicated the peak point of his day to
        doing so? Sure, there are certainly people who are crazy about their
        cars. Perhaps even so much so that polishing their rims is equivalent
        to... what else do car people enjoy? The point is, I am not a person who
        is crazy about their car, and if you would have seen my car before I
        washed it as part of my daily highlight, you would 100% agree with that
        statement. But despite it, there it was, marked in red in the schedule,
        me washing the car and being supposed to enjoy every second of it.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        I did not think about any of that when I marked it in my calendar. I
        said the night before that I would like to wash my car, and that I
        should do it as a highlight. Intrusive thoughts, such as{" "}
        <i>"Is this something I enjoy?"</i>, did not even come up. I scheduled
        it, I even looked forward to it. I relished taking care of that vehicle.
        I enjoyed dusting off the dashboard to make it nice and shiny. I even
        took a step back at the end to admire how clean this small car can look.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        It was only at the end of the day that I realized what I had done.
        Looking back at my schedule, I noticed that I did not pretend to enjoy
        washing the car. It became my daily highlight, through the sheer act of
        defining it as such. Setting a car-cleaning highlight of the day
        triggered a chain reaction that seems to have taken root in my habits
        before. Up to this point, I limited my daily highlights to things I knew
        I would enjoy. Those were those beautiful red spots in the late parts of
        my schedule that would give me that energy boost or that sense of
        fulfillment.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        And that is when it hit me: By setting a daily highlight, I had trained
        my brain to focus on one thing each day. At the same time, I gave myself
        the reward that was the activity itself. Keep in mind, those highlights
        were things I enjoy, always. I enforced and reinforced the idea that the
        daily highlight is the peak point of enjoyment every day. And then,
        simply by marking a mundane task in a bright red, my brain assumed it to
        be a good thing. Something to focus on. An activity to store in the{" "}
        <i>"Oh boy, you are so looking forward to this"</i> folder. Only giving
        something as tiring as washing your car a label I had used for a while,
        gave me that dopamine and serotonin rush that we all desire.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        I had transformed a banal task into something I latched on to for
        enjoyment, just for that one day. I had created <i>"fake time"</i>, a
        part of my day that needed to be the way it was, and that I tricked my
        brain into believing it was the best thing ever.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        Now, if I were to figuratively wash my car every day, this effect would
        likely cease to exist. The amazing thing would become great, would
        become normal, would become boring. And ideally, this is probably how it
        should be. You do not want your highlight to become things that you have
        to do only. That's not a highlight! I keep on using my highlight for
        things that bring me enjoyment or progress. However, the idea that a
        simple task on my To-Do list could be moved to the high spot without me
        even realizing it to be boring offers the possibility of getting those
        things done over time, which in turn makes time for more highlights. I
        was skeptical, but simply trying proved me wrong.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        What can you take away from my little self-experiment? First of all, I
        would like for you to try the same thing. Not the part about
        transforming the mundane to the brilliant. That part may or may not show
        up by itself. Set a daily highlight. Mark it down, make it visible.
        Commit to it. What helped me is to consider the highlight as blocked
        time, something that needs to be where and when it is, no questions
        asked. It became surprisingly easy to keep it a stable habit.
      </p>
      <p className="paragraph">
        If that ends up working for you, I would recommend reading{" "}
        <i>"Make time"</i>. I have yet to try all the strategies to create more
        time in your life myself, and if they all have a similar impact to what
        has been detailed here, they surely are... well, worth your time. Up
        until then, I will continue adding highlights to each of my days. But
        occasionally, I might garnish it with something boring but essential and
        unexpected. A sprinkle of <i>"fake time"</i>.
